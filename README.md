1. Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print out their product. 

2. Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6.

3. Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. 
      •If the number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue.•If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word red.

5. Write pseudo code that will count all the even numbers up to a user defined stopping point.
    For example, say we want to see the first 5 even numbers starting from 0. well, even numbers are 0, 2, 4, etc. :
      The first 5 even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
      The first 8 even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ,10 ,12, 16 

6. Write pseudo code that will perform the following. a) Read in 5 separate numbers.b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
